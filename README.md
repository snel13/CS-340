databases

http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~nelsons3/wineDatabase/food-wine-DB-main.php

Database has a lot to be input but for starters:
under pairs by your wine name: Malbec
pairs by your wine type: Bold Red
pairs by food name: Brown Rice
All of the above work...others work as well but not all options pair yet because the database hasn't been populated with food and pairings.
